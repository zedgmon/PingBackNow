Hey, I need to continue from a previous chat where I covered a lot of details about my SaaS project. I want you to fully understand everything we've discussed so we can seamlessly continue from where we left off. Below is EVERYTHING you need to know:

ðŸ“Œ PROJECT OVERVIEW
I am building a SaaS tool called PingBackNow.

Purpose: It automatically returns missed calls via SMS, allowing businesses to instantly follow up with customers.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
Backend: Express.js, Node.js
Database: PostgreSQL (I originally used Google Sheets but am transitioning)
Hosting & Dev: Replit
Emails: SendGrid (for account verification, password reset, etc.)
This is a light mode app (no dark mode), and users stay in light mode after logging in.

We are NOT incorporating AI into this app, so no AI-related wording should be used in the marketing copy.

ðŸ“Œ DATABASE & DATA STORAGE
Initially, Google Sheets was used to store user data, but I am now moving everything to PostgreSQL.

I want Google Sheets to be used only for admin tracking and not for user data storage.

Admin Tracking in Google Sheets (for now):

Users
Subscription type
Payments made
Signup date & active status
Usage analytics (SMS & call logs)
Long-term goal: Replace Google Sheets with a proper admin dashboard where I can see all user data in a structured way.

ðŸ“Œ AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT
Users now log in with their email instead of just a username.
Upon account creation, users should receive an email to verify their account.
I want to set up password reset emails using SendGrid.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is something I might want to add later.
SendGrid API key is stored securely in Replit Secrets as SENDGRID_API_KEY.
I need a Replit AI Agent prompt to set up password reset functionality with SendGrid.
ðŸ“Œ GITHUB & VERSION CONTROL
I recently connected my Replit project to GitHub to manage versions properly.
I encountered GitHub Push Protection errors because my SendGrid API key was accidentally committed.
I fixed this by:
Removing the API key from Git history
Updating .gitignore to prevent secrets from being committed again
Force-pushing the cleaned repository
Goal: Learn how to properly use GitHub for:
Branching (so I can test AI-generated changes before committing)
Rolling back changes if needed
Safely managing environment variables
ðŸ“Œ LANDING PAGE IMPROVEMENTS
The pricing section & calculator are perfect and should NOT be changed.
However, the hero section, CTAs, and color scheme need improvement.
Areas that need work:
Better visual elements (the page looks too basic)
Stronger CTA buttons & copywriting
More engaging design
I want Replit AI to improve the hero section but NOT commit changes directly so I can review them first.
Lead Capture Form:
I am considering adding a form for users to submit their info.
I need recommendations on which form tools/APIs to integrate.
Blog: I am thinking about adding a blog to my site.
Should I use an external CMS, or can I manage posts directly within my Replit project?
What is the best way to structure blog content?
ðŸ“Œ DNS & EMAIL VERIFICATION
I set up my domain in Squarespace and configured DNS records for SendGrid email verification.
I initially had errors due to CNAME record mismatches, but I fixed them by ensuring correct values.
I have now successfully verified my domain in SendGrid and can send transactional emails.
ðŸ“Œ SUPERADMIN ACCOUNT & DASHBOARD
I need to set up a superadmin account where I can:
Monitor all users
Reset passwords manually if needed
Manage subscriptions
Track SMS and call logs
Question: Should this be a separate link (e.g., /admin), a login page with admin privileges, or a standalone dashboard?
Password Management:
How should I handle superadmin password management securely?
What is the best approach for admin authentication and access control?
ðŸ“Œ PASSWORD RESET & 2FA
Now that SendGrid is verified, I need Replit AI to set up a password reset email flow.
Users should receive a secure, time-limited password reset link.
Do I need additional APIs for this, or can Replit AI handle it natively?
If I want to add Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) later, what are the best practices for integrating it?

ðŸ“Œ FINAL REQUEST
Now that you have ALL the context from my last chat, please help me with the next steps.

First priority:

Make sure password reset links are secure, time-limited, and stored in PostgreSQL.
