"Modify the billing page to allow users to cancel their subscriptions. Follow these steps:"

1️⃣ Add a "Cancel Subscription" Button to the Billing Page
Place the button below the plan selection and SMS usage section.
Style it as a red-bordered button with hover effects for clear visibility.
Clicking the button should trigger a confirmation popup to prevent accidental cancellations.
2️⃣ Backend: Handle Subscription Cancellation Request
Create a new API route (/cancel-subscription) to handle user cancellation requests.
Retrieve the current user's Stripe customer_id from the system.
Find the user's active subscription in Stripe.
Cancel the subscription using Stripe's API, setting cancel_at_period_end=True, so the user retains access until the billing period ends.
Return a confirmation response to the frontend after cancellation.
3️⃣ Update UI After Cancellation
When the cancellation is successful, display a notification confirming the cancellation.
Update the UI to indicate the subscription is pending cancellation and prevent further billing actions.
Disable the cancel button once the cancellation request is confirmed to prevent multiple submissions.
4️⃣ Ensure Webhook Listens for Final Cancellation
Set up a webhook listener to detect customer.subscription.deleted events from Stripe.
When Stripe finalizes the cancellation, update the user’s account status in the system.
Ensure the backend properly marks the account as inactive or unsubscribed when the subscription ends.
5️⃣ Error Handling & Edge Cases
If no active subscription is found, display an error message instead of allowing cancellation.
If the Stripe API fails, return a fallback message advising the user to contact support.
Ensure users cannot downgrade while a cancellation is pending, to prevent billing conflicts.
Expected Result
A Cancel Subscription button appears on the billing page.
Clicking the button prompts the user to confirm cancellation.
After confirmation, the system sends the request to Stripe and updates the UI.
A webhook listens for final confirmation and marks the account as inactive.
