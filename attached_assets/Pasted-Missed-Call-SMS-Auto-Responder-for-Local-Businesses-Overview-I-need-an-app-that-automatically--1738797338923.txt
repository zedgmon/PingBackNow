Missed Call & SMS Auto-Responder for Local Businesses 📲
Overview:
I need an app that automatically responds to missed calls and SMS messages for local businesses using the Twilio API. It should also allow businesses to schedule follow-up texts, collect lead details, and save them in Google Sheets, functioning as a lightweight CRM. The app should include AI-powered suggested replies using OpenAI (optional).

Core Features:
1️⃣ Missed Call Auto-Responder
Detect missed calls via Twilio and send an automated SMS response like:
"Hi! We missed your call. How can we help?"
Option for businesses to customize the auto-response message.
Logs missed calls and responses in a dashboard.
2️⃣ Scheduled Follow-Up Texts
Businesses can schedule follow-up messages manually.
UI should include a simple calendar-style picker for scheduling.
Sends messages via Twilio at the scheduled time.
3️⃣ AI-Suggested Replies (Optional AI Feature)
Uses OpenAI API to suggest responses based on the conversation.
AI should provide 3 suggested replies for the business owner to choose from.
Businesses can edit or approve AI-generated replies before sending.
4️⃣ Lead Capture & Google Sheets Integration
Collects customer name, phone number, and message intent.
Saves all lead details in a Google Sheet for easy tracking.
Allows filtering and exporting of leads.
5️⃣ Simple Subscription-Based Pricing
$99/month → 1,000 SMS included
$199/month → 5,000 SMS included
Extra SMS → $0.05 per SMS
Simple Stripe payment integration for subscriptions.
